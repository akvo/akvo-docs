Overview
========

This document describes what we call Akvo's fundamental requirements. These requirements describe the core thoughts and principles around which Akvo Foundation was created, how it is operated on a daily basis, and the rational behind it. Not only is it a non-trivial task to write fundamental requirements down, the requirements constantly change, so this document will never be "finished".

This document has both organisational and technical requirements listed, as we believe some of the organisational requirements drive technical requirements, even if not all do. However, it would feel disjointed to list only those that do drive technical requirements so we list all of them here.

Akvo does not have an official "vision and mission", but it is quite a good way of describing what we do, so we use it here anyway.

Akvo's vision
-------------
We see a future in which international development is open, transparent and collaborative. 

Akvo's mission
--------------
We build a superior open online platform and a trusted partner network which allows international development to be collaborated around, financed through, reported on and monitored, via interoperable platforms.

Akvo's strategy
---------------
We will achieve this mission by balancing the construction of tools with the assembly of a network of partners and communication about our progress, to create a strong combination of people, organisations and tools to get the job done. We use open-source methods and tools wherever practical and possible. We only build what is not already available open-source and we openly share all the tools and content which we create. 


Organisational requirements
===========================

1. The right people are key
-----------------------------
**Requirement**: We strongly believe that it is core to success to have the right people as part of our team.

**Implementation**: We put team chemistry foremost in our requirements on new colleagues. We don't hire a list of skills, we hire a person. We do several interviews by the colleagues who will work with any potential new co-worker and then if we think it will work out we do a real project together on a contract, for 3 months. If the consensus is that the new colleague is right for us then we hire her or sign a longer term contract. 

**Rationale**: We have a lot of experience telling us that this is the best hiring process we have been able to find. 

2. Work on "stuff that matters"
-------------------------------
**Requirement**: We should work on things that make a significant impact that fits our vision.

**Implementation**: We have selected to work on an online platform and a trusted partner network in the space of international development. 

**Rationale**: We believe that it is important to do more things than just make money. But we also believe that we should get paid for the good work that we do. We believe that the right way to go about this is to create an non-profit foundation which is also "not for loss", i.e. it should have a sustainable business model.
"Work on Stuff that Matters" is probably best described by Tim O'Reilly, who managed to capture the essence of this several years after we had decided to do this: http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html

3. Be entrepreneurial
----------------------
**Requirement**: An entrepreneurial approach is key to success.

**Implementation**: We have strong entrepreneurs as part of our team.

**Rationale**: Working in an environment which is often very conservative in its approach (development aid and country governance) we have to be entrepreneurial to not become stuck in old fashioned and traditional ways of doing things. Especially as we are brought in to help implement positive change.

**Comment**: All Akvo's co-founders, directors and many of our staff have been individual entrepreneurs, company founders or part of small organisations growing quickly. Keeping an entrepreneurial ethos and spirit is key to our continued success. We are often pushing back against requirements which are not only unnecessary, but even striving backwards, back to systems "the way it used to be".
Akvo's methods and approach, much of which is focused on an entrepreneurial can-do attitude, are based on openness, transparency, collaboration and sharing, often goes against the grain of development aid organisations and governments. Despite us being invited to help introduce our methods, tools and approach, often by top-level management or government officials, the middle or lower level management or officials and bureaucrats push back and resist the change. We must not become what we are supposed to change.

4. Trusted partner network
--------------------------
**Requirement**: Partners using Akvo's tools should be trusted.

**Implementation**: Akvo has a tiered partner network. To be a partner which can bring in other partners to be part of the network you have to be classified as a Support partner. Support partners go through a screening process. 

**Rationale**: The concept of a Trusted Partner Network exists within the Akvo network of partners. The idea is that you should be able to trust that a particular partner does a good job in implementing projects in their area of specialisation. Organisations and individuals come to Akvo to ask for advice on where to invest money or grant money to projects. They rely on our or our Support partners judgment that a partner can be trusted to do a good job.

**Comment**: The Akvo Support partners go through a process to become a support partner. The criteria, the tasks and responsibilities of a typical support partner and the process of becoming a support parter is documented here: http://www.akvo.org/web/partner_rules

5. Equal opportunities 
-----------------------
**Requirement**: We treat everyone working with us, contractors or employees equitably. 

**Implementation**: We don't discriminate against anyone or any group. We also treat everyone equitably with regards to compensation and work environment, regardless if they are employees or long term contractors.

**Rationale**: It is natural to us not to discriminate against anyone or any group. Akvo is also a very distributed organisation. At the time of this writing (November 2012), we have about 30 people on short and long term contracts or as employees, based in seven countries working both from home and from some hub locations (Amsterdam, London, Stockholm, Nairobi, Washington DC and more). To be successful we need to treat everyone equitably and well.

6. Participatory team environment
----------------------------------
**Requirement**: We need a work environment which demands personal responsibility, which requires strong ownership of the tasks at hand and encourages full participation of everyone.

**Implementation**: We have a highly participatory team environment with a flat organisation structure, with very open communication internally and externally.

**Rationale**: In a fast moving distributed organisation with highly motivated individuals we need people to know they can take responsibility for tasks and problems and get things done. We believe that this is best done in a flat organisation and with  

7. No disaster response engagements
-----------------------------------
**Requirement**: Akvo does not build systems specifically for disaster response.

**Implementation**: We do not build disaster response systems and we don't market our systems as such.

**Rationale**: There are several reasons why Akvo doesn't build disaster response systems:

- Disaster response have a very different set of requirements than what the requirements are for reporting and monitoring systems built to handle long term infrastructure projects. 

- There are quite a few organisations which work with disaster response already and we don't see that we would add as much value if did that too. We believe that working on systems for everyday use provides better return on investment.




Technical requirements
======================

The technical requirements are structured in three sections for each requirement. Requirements statement. Implementation statement. Rational statement. One key reason for structuring it this way is to make it easy to quickly browse and get an overview understanding of what we are trying to do.

1. Sustainable and resilient systems
------------------------------------
**Requirement**: We need an information and data eco-system which is sustainable and resilient.

**Implementation**: We build open systems.

**Rationale**: To quickly create successful information and data systems to achieve our vision, we argue that together we must make use of open systems. This will allow many of us to collaborate and to quickly reach the next level. It is the fastest method which also creates a sustainable and resilient information eco-system.

**Comment**: 

By open systems we mean:

- using **open standards** to work with data, for example to track progress towards goals and objectives, complimented with an open data exchange format, as exemplified in the IATI XML standard

- **open data**, where all the data is open with anyone free to use, reuse, and redistribute it â€” subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share-alike

- **open APIs**, where different computer systems containing goal data can interchange the data automatically via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), the APIs should be open, meaning that their form may be copied freely by others as well as being accessible and usable by anyone

- **open source software**, where the underlying software that drives the systems which collects, collates, stores and distributes the data are built on software that adhere to the open source standards set by the Open Source Initiative


2. Fast and resilient knowledge sharing when building systems
-------------------------------------------------------------
**Requirement**: We need knowledge sharing which is fast and resilient

**Implementation**: We use open licenses

**Rationale**: Open knowledge sharing has proven to be the fastest way to create more and better knowledge, as well as sharing this knowledge widely, as exemplified by most academic research and Wikipedia. We believe that stating upfront that our information is available openly, through the use of open licenses, we not only promote sharing, but we also ensure that our information is treated correctly by others.

3. Open data and content
------------------------
**Requirement**: All data in our systems needs to be open. 

**Implementation**: All of our systems publish data and content1 under an open license. (With a few exceptions below.) All our systems have open APIs which allow data to be extracted and used for other purposes. We use open licensing for the data which our partners enter into our systems. We use two licenses in particular: Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike (CC-BY-SA) and the Open Database License (ODbL). Photographs or pictures entered into Akvo RSR use the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike Non-commercial (CC-BY-SA-NC), as it may not be comfortable for many NGOs to have commercial use of their photography.

**Rationale**: [TBD]

4. Akvo only works on "safe" data
---------------------------------
**Requirement**: We do not work on data which need very high levels of security protection or shouldn't be published for some reason.

**Implementation**: [TBD]

**Rationale**: Some data which one could collect with our systems could be needing high levels of security protection. For example, one could imagine collecting data about refugee camps near to a war zone. If we have detailed data [TBD]

5. Privacy
----------

**Requirement**: We need privacy for some of our data

**Implementation**: We host data in Europe, primarily in the Netherlands. We don't consider the US having adequate data protection legislation and will move away from US services when  possible.

**Rationale**: Even when you are working with open data there is always some data which needs to be kept private. Examples would be: 

- household data from surveys
- user data from user accounts, login information, API keys etc.

Other data that we want to keep private is data which could be used to compete against us. In particular there are some data which we don't want to tempt our competitors or potential future competitors with, so we shouldn't put it under their control. This in particular is: 

- web site traffic data

As we are working with information which could potentially be politically sensitive, such as data on water, and we have several partners which we work with that are national governments and large multilateral organisations, we should host data in jurisdictions with good privacy and data protection laws.

6. Handling of private data
---------------------------

**Requirement**: If our partners have private data, such as household survey data, then some type of summary data should be published openly anyway.

**Implementation**: We should have functions which allow our systems to always openly publish anonymised or summary data.

**Rationale**: If we start compromising on open data then there will more and more arguments from organisations which don't want to publish open data from our systems that their data is somehow different and needs to be secret. If we don't enforce open data at system level then we will be fighting a losing battle against the urges to keep data secret. 

7. Transparency in reporting
----------------------------
**Requirement**: Our tools should handle changes to reports in an open and transparent way.

**Implementation**: In Akvo RSR updates can not be changed or deleted by the user.

**Comment**: There have been requests to improve on this feature in Akvo RSR.

**Rationale**: For significant progress with tools like Akvo RSR the Akvo Trusted Partner Network needs to be able to demonstrate integrity by openly showing that information is not manipulated retroactively on started projects. Information which is entered about a project should not change without some type of revision history and reason for the change.

**Comment**: The current implementation of this falls short in Akvo RSR. There should probably be a revision history function of changes to updates and project information with a clearly presented user interface showing who changed what when. Currently only Akvo staff can change the content or delete an update. Anyone with access privileges (which are set quite wide, i.e. anyone who has a Project Editor account and where a project belong to that organisation) can change the content and budget for a published project, without any visible change tracking.

8. Projects presentation should meet a certain quality level
-------------------------------------------------------------
**Requirement**: 

**Implementation**: 

**Rationale**: 

**Comment**:
